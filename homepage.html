            <h4>Super computer predicts City to win the league  after everton point reduction</h4>
        <img src="C:\Users\RAYO\Documents\project\test_site\Imagesfolder\league.png">
            <p>Manchester City have been tipped by a football supercomputer to claim a record-breaking fourth straight Premier League title.

                Pep Guardiola has overseen an incredible period of Premier League dominance at City, with five of the last six titles in the trophy cabinet at the Etihad. The Catalan reached the pinnacle of European football last season, adding the FA Cup and Champions League for a historic treble.

                No team in the Premier League era has won four consecutive titles but the supercomputer from Bettingexpert has predicted City to do exactly that. Guardiola's side have been backed to finish on around 84 points, which would put them four points clear of second-placed Arsenal.</p>

    <h4>Pep clash with Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez after City Draw with Liverpool</h4>
    <img src="C:\Users\RAYO\Documents\project\test_site\Imagesfolder\pepandNunez.avif">
    <p>Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola and Liverpool striker Darwin Núñez got into a heated argument at full-time in Saturday’s early Premier League kick-off between the sides at the Etihad Stadium.

        Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was seen pulling Núñez away from the tense situation after the Uruguayan number nine had been substituted in the second half of the clash. Klopp blocked Núñez’s mouth to stop him from attacking Guardiola verbally, while his assistant Pep Lijnders was also seen pushing Guardiola away to prevent an escalation.
        
        Members of staff from both clubs became involved to diffuse the situation between the two benches as the full-time whistle went. It remains to be seen what was said between Guardiola and Núñez but the Catalan coach and Klopp were later seen discussing the incident on the touchline before a furious Guardiola went to the Liverpool dugout to speak with more members of the club’s coaching staff.
